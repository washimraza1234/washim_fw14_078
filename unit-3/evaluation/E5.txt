Question 1: What is lazy loading and eager loading in hibernate?

Answer:  Eager Loading is a design pattern in which data initialization occurs on the spot.

Lazy Loading: Lazy Loading is a design pattern which is used to defer initialization of an object as long as it's possible


Question 2: Explain @Cascade and @mappedBy annotations:

Answer: 
		@cascade:
Cascading is a feature in Hibernate, which is used to manage the state of the mapped entity whenever the state of its relationship owner (superclass) affected. When the relationship owner (superclass) is saved/ deleted, then the mapped entity associated with it should also be saved/ deleted automatically. Mostly cascading is used in Hibernate mapping strategies.
To access cascade, we need to declare @Cascade annotation in the POJO class. The @Cascade annotation contains a parameter called CascadeType, which defines the types of cascade strategy. The cascadeType is available in org.hibernate.annotation.Cascade package.

@mappedBy:

In JPA or Hibernate, entity associations are directional, either unidirectional or bidirectional. Always mappedBy attribute is used in bidirectional association to link with other side of entity.
mappedBy attribute indicates that which entity owns the relationship and what reference is used for non-owning entity within owner entity 


What is ORM in Hibernate?

Answer: Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a functionality which is used to develop and maintain a relationship between an object and relational database by mapping an object state to database column. It is capable to handle various database operations easily such as inserting, updating, deleting etc.
