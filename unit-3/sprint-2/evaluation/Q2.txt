A transaction is a single logical unit of work that accesses and possibly modifies the contents of a database. Transactions access data using read and write operations. 
In order to maintain consistency in a database, before and after the transaction, certain properties are followed. These are called ACID properties. 

Abort: If a transaction aborts, changes made to the database are not visible. 
Commit: If a transaction commits, changes made are visible. 


Atomicity:- Transaction Manager.

Consistency:-Application programmer.

Isolation:-Concurrency Control Manager.

Durability:-Recovery Manager.


The ACID properties, in totality, provide a mechanism to ensure the correctness and consistency of a database in a way such that each transaction is a group of operations that acts as a single unit, produces consistent results, acts in isolation from other operations, and updates that it makes are durably stored.
