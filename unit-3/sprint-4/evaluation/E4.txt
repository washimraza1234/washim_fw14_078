Question 1.)  What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?

Answer:- The advantages of Hibernate over JDBC are:

a. Hibernate code will work well for all databases, for ex: Oracle,MySQL, etc. where as JDBC is database specific.

b. No knowledge of SQL is needed because Hibernate is a set of objects and a table is treated as an object, where as to work with JDBC, one need to know SQL.

c. Query tuning is not required in Hibernate. The query tuning is automatic in hibernate by using criteria queries, and the result of performance is at its best. Where as in JDBC the query tuning is to be done by the database authors.




Question 2.) Explain difference between JPA and Hibernate:

Answer:- JPA: 
a.  JPA is only a specification, it is not an implementation.

b. It is a set of rules and guidelines to set interfaces for implementing object-relational mapping .

c. It needs a few classes and interfaces.


HIBERNATE:

a. Hibernate is an implementation of JPA guidelines.
b. It helps in mapping Java data types to SQL data types.
c. It is the contributor of JPA.


Explain Layered Architecture:

Hibernate has a layered architecture which helps the user to operate without having to know the underlying APIs. Hibernate makes use of the database and configuration data to provide persistence services (and persistent objects) to the application.
Hibernate uses various existing Java APIs, like JDBC, Java Transaction API(JTA), and Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). JDBC provides a rudimentary level of abstraction of functionality common to relational databases, allowing almost any database with a JDBC driver to be supported by Hibernate. JNDI and JTA allow Hibernate to be integrated with J2EE application servers.
