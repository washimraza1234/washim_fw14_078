Question 1:

Tight-Coupling:
In general, Tight coupling means the two classes often change together. In other words, if A knows more than it should about the way in which B was implemented, then A and B are tightly coupled.


Loose-Coupling:
In simple words, loose coupling means they are mostly independent. If the only knowledge that class A has about class B, is what class B has exposed through its interface, then class A and class B are said to be loosely coupled. In order to over come from the problems of tight coupling between objects, spring framework uses dependency injection mechanism with the help of POJO/POJI model and through dependency injection its possible to achieve loose coupling.

Question 2:

Spring IoC Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components that make up the application. It gets the information about the objects from a configuration file(XML) or Java Code or Java Annotations and Java POJO class. These objects are called Beans. Since the Controlling of Java objects and their lifecycle is not done by the developers, hence the name Inversion Of Control. 

Spring IoC is the mechanism to achieve loose-coupling between Objects dependencies. To achieve loose coupling and dynamic binding of the objects at runtime, objects dependencies are injected by other assembler objects.
