Question 2:
Explain the difference between JPA and Hibernate, and What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?


Answer:
The Difference between JPA and Hibernate:

-JPA is described in javax.persistence package.
-It describes the handling of relational data in Java applications.
-It is not an implementation.It is only a Java specification.
-It is a standard API that permits to perform database operations.


-Hibernate is described in org.hibernate package.                                                                   -Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that is used to save the Java objects in the relational   database system.
-Hibernate is an implementation of JPA. Hence, the common standard which is given by JPA is followed by Hibernate.
-It is used in mapping Java data types with SQL data types and database tables.



Advantages of using hibernate over JDBC.
---------------------------------------
-Hibernate supports Inheritance, Associations, Collections.
-In hibernate if we save the derived class object,  then its base class object will also be stored into the database, it means hibernate supporting  inheritance
-Hibernate supports relationships like One-To-Many,One-To-One, Many-To-Many-to-Many, Many-To-One
-This will also supports collections like List,Set,Map (Only new collections)
-In jdbc all exceptions are checked exceptions, so we must write code in try, catch and throws, but in hibernate we only have Un-checked exceptions, so no    need to write try, catch, or no need to write throws.
