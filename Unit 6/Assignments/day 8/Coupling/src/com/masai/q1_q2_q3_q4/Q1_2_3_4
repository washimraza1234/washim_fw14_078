Q1.)  What is the J2EE, list out some of the Application Server names?

Answer: J2EE stands for Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition. J2EE is the standard platform for developing applications in the enterprise and is designed for enterprise applications that run on servers. J2EE provides APIs that let developers create workflows and make use of resources such as databases or web services. J2EE consists of a set of APIs. Developers can use these APIs to build applications for business computing.

Q4.) Write Short notes on how the Spring framework evolves.

Answer:Developing an enterprise application with EJB was not easy, as the developer needed to perform various tasks, such as creating Home and Remote interfaces and implementing lifecycle callback methods which lead to the complexity of providing code for EJBs Due to this complication, developers started looking for an easier way to develop enterprise applications.
The Spring framework(which is commonly known as Spring) has emerged as a solution to all these complications This framework uses various new techniques such as Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), Plain Old Java Object (POJO), and dependency injection (DI), to develop enterprise applications, thereby removing the complexities involved while developing enterprise applications using EJB, Spring is an open source lightweight framework that allows Java EE 7 developers to build simple, reliable, and scalable enterprise applications. This framework mainly focuses on providing various ways to help you manage your business objects. It made the development of Web applications much easier as compared to classic Java frameworks and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), such as Java database connectivity(JDBC), JavaServer Pages(JSP), and Java Servlet.
