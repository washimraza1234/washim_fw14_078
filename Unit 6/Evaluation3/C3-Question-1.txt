Q1/- What do you mean by the IOC, explain the life cycle of the Spring Bean.

Answer:
Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components that make up the application. It gets the information about the objects from a configuration file(XML) or Java Code or Java Annotations and Java POJO class. These objects are called Beans. Since the Controlling of Java objects and their lifecycle is not done by the developers, hence the name Inversion Of Control.

Bean life cycle is managed by the spring container. When we run the program then, first of all, the spring container gets started. After that, the container creates the instance of a bean as per the request, and then dependencies are injected. And finally, the bean is destroyed when the spring container is closed. Therefore, if we want to execute some code on the bean instantiation and just after closing the spring container, then we can write that code inside the custom init() method and the destroy() method.
