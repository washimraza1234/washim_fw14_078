String:-

Strings in Java are Objects that are backed internally by a char array. Since arrays are immutable(cannot grow),
Strings are immutable as well. 
Whenever a change to a String is made, an entirely new String is created. 
Example,-

String str = "Apple";



StringBuffer:- 
Java StringBuffer class is used to create mutable (modifiable) String objects.
 The StringBuffer class in Java is the same as String class except it is mutable i.e. it can be changed.

StringBuilder:-
Java StringBuilder class is used to create mutable (modifiable) String. 
The Java StringBuilder class is same as StringBuffer class except that it is non-synchronized. 

Example:-
class StringBuilderExample{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder("Hello ");  
sb.append("Java");//now original string is changed  
System.out.println(sb);//prints Hello Java  
}  
} 


toString():-
A toString() is an in-built method in Java that returns the value given to it in string format.
Hence, any object that this method is applied on, will then be returned as a string object.
