QUESTION 1:

What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?

Answer:
Hibernate supports relationships like One-To-Many,One-To-One, Many-To-Many, Many-To-One.

This will also supports collections like List,Set,Map (Only new collections)

Hibernate supports Inheritance, Associations, Collections.

In hibernate if we save the derived class object, then its base class object will also be stored into the database, it means hibernate supporting inheritance.

Hibernate has its own query language, i.e hibernate query language which is database independent
So if we change the database, then also our application will works as HQL is database independent
HQL contains database independent commands.

Hibernate supports annotations, apart from XML.
