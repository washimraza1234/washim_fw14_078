----------STATIC------------
A static method is a method that belongs to a class, but it does not belong to an instance of that 
class and this method can be called without the instance or object of that class. 
Every method in java defaults to a non-static method without static keyword preceding it.

Example----
public static int sum(int a, int b)
    {
        // Simply returning the sum
        return a + b;
    }


-----------NONSTATIC----------
Non-static methods can access any static method and static variable, without creating an instance of the object.

Example,
public int sum(int a, int b)
    {
        // Returning sum of numbers
        return a + b;
    }
